Term Reading Project
--------------------

- Get familiar with Google Scholar (or other scientific publication database of
your choice)
- Search for a technical article that is on the topics of applied geophysics
(gravity, magnetic, electrical, electromagnetic and well logging)
- Discuss the article chosen with the instructor
- Complete a work sheet about the article before the mid-term exam (the work sheet
counts for 20% of the mid-term exam)
- Continue reading until the end of term and present the article on the last day
of class
- Read carefully because you will need the article in your final exam!
