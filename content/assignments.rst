Term Reading Project
--------------------

- Get familiar with Google Scholar (or other scientific publication database of your choice)

- Search for a technical article that is on the topics of applied geophysics (gravity, magnetic, electrical, electromagnetic and well logging)

- Discuss the article chosen with the instructor

- Complete a fact sheet about the article before the mid-term exam (the fact sheet counts for 30% of the mid-term exam)

- Continue reading until the end of term and present the article on the last day of class

- Read carefully because you will need the article in your final exam!
